# Tech Blog

## Description
This template uses the MVC paradigm in order to function using Node.js, Handlebars, BCrypt, Express, and more. With so much working at the same time, it's a comprehensive app that allows you to write your own blog posts, edit them, delete them, and make your own sign up and login form. This app also uses JawsDB through Heroku in order to perform and to log in correctly. While it doesn't use HTML, it does use it in the form of Handlebars and a mix of javascript. CSS is normal with this app as well, so it was easy to style to get where you want it to be. The most complicated part of this assignment was making sure that everything was labeled correctly across all of the different folders and files. With there being so many different moving pieces, it was sometimes difficult to gauge where the error happened and it took a little group help in order to get it working.
